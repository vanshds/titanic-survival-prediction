🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Using Decision Tree
This project builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using a Decision Tree classifier. The dataset is the popular Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

📋 Project Overview
🎯 The goal is to classify whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as passenger class, sex, age, and fare.

🛠️ Technologies Used
📓 Jupyter Notebook
📊 pandas for data manipulation
🤖 scikit-learn for Decision Tree modeling
📈 matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

📂 Dataset
📥 Source: Kaggle Titanic dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

🔑 Features used:

🎫 Pclass (Passenger Class)
🚻 Sex
🎂 Age
💰 Fare
🎯 Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
